# Rerverse Number using Transformer Network

Predicts the reverse of a given number using a custom built and trained transformer model with 100% accuracy.

## The Transformer Architecture
The Transformer architecture follows an encoder-decoder structure, 
but does not rely on recurrence and convolutions in order to generate an output. 

In a nutshell, the task of the encoder, on the left half of the Transformer architecture, 
is to map an input sequence to a sequence of continuous representations, which is then fed into a decoder. 

The decoder, on the right half of the architecture, receives the output of the encoder
 together with the decoder output at the previous time step, to generate an output sequence.
